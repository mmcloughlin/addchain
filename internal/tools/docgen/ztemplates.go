However the\nmost user-friendly method uses the {{ pkg \"alg/ensemble\" }} package to\ninstantiate a sensible default set of algorithms and the {{ pkg \"alg/exec\" }}\nhelper to execute them in parallel. The following code uses this method to\nfind an addition chain for curve25519 field inversion:\n\n```go\n{{ snippet \"alg/exec/example_test.go\" \"func Example\" \"^}\" -}}\n```\n\n## Algorithms\n\n### Binary\n\nThe {{ pkg \"alg/binary\" }} package implements the addition chain equivalent\nof the basic [square-and-multiply exponentiation\nmethod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring). It is\nincluded for completeness, but is almost always outperformed by more advanced\nalgorithms below.\n\n### Continued Fractions\n\nThe {{ pkg \"alg/contfrac\" }} package implements the continued fractions\nmethods for addition sequence search introduced by\nBergeron-Berstel-Brlek-Duboc in 1989 and later extended. This approach\nutilizes a decomposition of an addition chain akin to continued fractions,\nnamely\n\n```\n(1,..., k,..., n) = (1,...,n mod k,..., k) {{ \"\\u2297\" }} (1,..., n/k) {{ \"\\u2295\" }} (n mod k).\n```\n\nfor certain special operators {{ \"\\u2297\" }} and {{ \"\\u2295\" }}. This\ndecomposition lends itself to a recursive algorithm for efficient addition\nsequence search, with results dependent on the _strategy_ for choosing the\nauxillary integer _k_. The {{ pkg \"alg/contfrac\" }} package provides a\nlaundry list of strategies from the literature: binary, co-binary,\ndichotomic, dyadic, fermat, square-root and total.\n\n#### References\n\n* {{ bibentry \"contfrac\" }}\n* {{ bibentry \"efficientcompaddchain\" }}\n* {{ bibentry \"gencontfrac\" }}\n* {{ bibentry \"hehcc:exp\" }}\n\n### Bos-Coster Heuristics\n\nBos and Coster described an iterative algorithm for efficient addition\nsequence generation in which at each step a heuristic proposes new numbers\nfor the sequence in such a way that the _maximum_ number always decreases.\nThe [original Bos-Coster paper]({{ biburl \"boscoster\" }}) defined four\nheuristics: Approximation, Divison, Halving and Lucas. Package\n{{ pkg \"alg/heuristic\" }} implements a variation on these heuristics:\n\n* **Approximation:** looks for two elements a, b in the current sequence with sum close to the largest element.\n* **Halving:** applies when the target is at least twice as big as the next largest, and if so it will propose adding a sequence of doublings.\n* **Delta Largest:** proposes adding the delta between the largest two entries in the current sequence.\n\nDivison and Lucas are not implemented due to disparities in the literature\nabout their precise definition and poor results from early experiments.\nFurthermore, this library does not apply weights to the heuristics as\nsuggested in the paper, rather it simply uses the first that applies. However\nboth of these remain [possible avenues for\nimprovement](https://github.com/mmcloughlin/addchain/issues/26).\n\n#### References\n\n* {{ bibentry \"boscoster\" }}\n* {{ bibentry \"github:kwantam/addchain\" }}\n* {{ bibentry \"hehcc:exp\" }}\n* {{ bibentry \"modboscoster\" }}\n* {{ bibentry \"mpnt\" }}\n* {{ bibentry \"speedsubgroup\" }}\n\n### Dictionary\n\nDictionary methods decompose the binary representation of a target integer _n_ into a set of dictionary _terms_, such that _n_\nmay be written as a sum\n\n```\nn = {{ \"\\u2211\" }} 2^{e_i} d_i\n```\n\nfor exponents _e_ and elements _d_ from a dictionary _D_. Given such a decomposition we can construct an addition chain for _n_ by\n\n1. Find a short addition _sequence_ containing every element of the dictionary _D_. Continued fractions and Bos-Coster heuristics can be used here.\n2. Build _n_ from the dictionary terms according to the sum decomposition.\n\nThe efficiency of this approach boils down to the decomposition method. The {{ pkg \"alg/dict\" }} package provides:\n\n* **Fixed Window:** binary representation of _n_ is broken into fixed _k_-bit windows\n* **Sliding Window**: break _n_ into _k_-bit windows, skipping zeros where possible\n* **Run Length**: decompose _n_ into runs of 1s up to a maximal length\n* **Hybrid**: mix of sliding window and run length methods\n\n#### References\n\n* {{ bibentry \"braueraddsubchains\" }}\n* {{ bibentry \"genshortchains\" }}\n* {{ bibentry \"hehcc:exp\" }}\n\n### Runs\n\nThe runs algorithm is a custom variant of the dictionary approach that decomposes\na target into runs of ones. It leverages the observation that building a\ndictionary consisting of runs of 1s of lengths `l_1, l_2, ..., l_k` can itself be\nreduced to:\n\n1. Find an addition sequence containing the run lengths `l_i`. As with\n   dictionary approaches we can use Bos-Coster heuristics and continued\n   fractions here. However here we have the advantage that the `l_i` are\n   typically very _small_, meaning that a wider range of algorithms can\n   be brought to bear.\n2. Use the addition sequence for the run lengths `l_i` to build an addition\n   sequence for the runs themselves `r(l_i)` where `r(e) = 2^e-1`. See\n   {{ sym \"alg/dict\" \"RunsChain\" }}.\n\nThis approach has proved highly effective against cryptographic exponents\nwhich frequently exhibit binary structure, such as those derived from\n[Solinas primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solinas_prime).\n\nWe have not yet found this method described in the literature, so it may be\na new development.\n\n### Optimization\n\n## Thanks\n\nThank you to [Tom Dean](https://web.stanford.edu/~trdean/), [Riad\nWahby](https://wahby.org/) and [Brian Smith](https://briansmith.org/) for\nadvice and encouragement.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to `addchain` are welcome:\n\n* [Submit bug reports](https://github.com/mmcloughlin/addchain/issues/new) to\n  the issues page.\n* Suggest [test cases](https://github.com/mmcloughlin/addchain/blob/e6c070065205efcaa02627ab1b23e8ce6aeea1db/internal/results/results.go#L62)\n  or update best-known hand-optimized results.\n* Pull requests accepted.
