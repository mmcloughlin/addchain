<p align="center">Cryptographic Addition Chain Generation in Go</p>

`addchain` generates short addition chains for exponents of cryptographic
interest with [results](#results) rivaling the best hand-optimized chains.
Intended to form a building block in elliptic curve or other cryptographic
code generators.

* Suite of algorithms from academic research: continued fractions,
  dictionary-based and Bos-Coster heuristics
* Custom run-length techniques exploit structure of cryptographic exponents
  with excellent results on Solinas primes
* Generic optimization methods eliminate redundant operations
* Simple domain-specific language for addition chain computations
* Command-line interface or library: use as a building block in cryptographic code
  generators

## Usage

### Command-line Interface

Install:

```
go get -u github.com/mmcloughlin/addchain/cmd/addchain
```

Search for a curve25519 field inversion addition chain with:

```sh
{{ include "internal/examples/cli/cmd.sh" -}}
```

Output:

```
{{ include "internal/examples/cli/output" -}}
```

### Library

Install:

```
go get -u github.com/mmcloughlin/addchain
```

Algorithms all conform to the `alg.ChainAlgorithm` or `alg.SequenceAlgorithm`
interfaces and can be used directly. However the most user-friendly method
uses the `alg/ensemble` package to instantiate a sensible default set of
algorithms and the `alg/exec` helper to execute them in parallel. The
following code uses this method to find an addition chain for curve25519
field inversion:

```go
{{ snippet "alg/exec/example_test.go" "func Example" "^}" -}}
```

## Results

| Name | Length | Best | Delta |
| ---- | -----: | ---: | ----: |
{{ range .Results -}}
{{- if gt .BestKnown 0 -}}
| [{{ .Name }}](doc/results.md#{{ anchor .Name }}) | {{ .Length }} | {{ .BestKnown }} | {{ printf "%+d" .Delta }} |
{{ end -}}
{{ end }}
