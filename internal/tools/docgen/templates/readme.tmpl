## Background

An [_addition chain_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition_chain) for a
target integer _n_ is a sequence of numbers starting at 1 and ending at _n_
such that every term is a sum of two numbers appearing earlier in the
sequence. For example, an addition chain for 29 is

```
1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 17, 25, 29
```

Addition chains arise in the optimization of exponentiation algorithms with
fixed exponents. For example, the addition chain above corresponds to the
following sequence of multiplications to compute `x^29`

<pre>
 x<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>1</sup> * x<sup>1</sup>
 x<sup>4</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> * x<sup>2</sup>
 x<sup>8</sup> = x<sup>4</sup> * x<sup>4</sup>
 x<sup>9</sup> = x<sup>1</sup> * x<sup>8</sup>
x<sup>17</sup> = x<sup>8</sup> * x<sup>9</sup>
x<sup>25</sup> = x<sup>8</sup> * x<sup>17</sup>
x<sup>29</sup> = x<sup>4</sup> * x<sup>25</sup>
</pre>

An exponentiation algorithm for a fixed exponent _n_ reduces to finding a
_minimal length addition chain_ for _n_. This is especially relevent in
cryptography where exponentiation by huge fixed exponents forms a
performance-critical component of finite-field arithmetic. In particular,
constant-time inversion modulo a prime _p_ is performed by computing `x^(p-2)
(mod p)`, thanks to [Fermat's Little
Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27_little_theorem). Square root
also reduces to exponentiation for some prime moduli. Finding short addition
chains for these exponents is one important part of high-performance finite
field implementations required for elliptic curve cryptography or RSA.

Minimal addition chain search is famously hard. No practical optimal
algorithm is known, especially for cryptographic exponents of size 256-bits
and up. Given its importance for the performance of cryptographic
implementations, implementers devote significant effort to hand-tune addition
chains. The `addchain` project aims to match or exceed the best
hand-optimized addition chains using entirely automated approaches, building
on extensive academic research and applying new tweaks that exploit the
unique nature of cryptographic exponents.

## Usage

### Command-line Interface

Install:

```
go get -u github.com/mmcloughlin/addchain/cmd/addchain
```

Search for a curve25519 field inversion addition chain with:

```sh
{{ include "internal/examples/cli/cmd.sh" -}}
```

Output:

```
{{ include "internal/examples/cli/output" -}}
```

### Library

Install:

```
go get -u github.com/mmcloughlin/addchain
```

Algorithms all conform to the {{ sym "alg" "ChainAlgorithm" }} or
{{ sym "alg" "SequenceAlgorithm" }} interfaces and can be used directly. However the
most user-friendly method uses the {{ pkg "alg/ensemble" }} package to
instantiate a sensible default set of algorithms and the {{ pkg "alg/exec" }}
helper to execute them in parallel. The following code uses this method to
find an addition chain for curve25519 field inversion:

```go
{{ snippet "alg/exec/example_test.go" "func Example" "^}" -}}
```

## Algorithms

### Binary

The {{ pkg "alg/binary" }} package implements the addition chain equivalent
of the basic [square-and-multiply exponentiation
method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring). It is
included for completeness, but is almost always outperformed by more advanced
algorithms below.

### Continued Fractions

The {{ pkg "alg/contfrac" }} package implements the continued fractions
methods for addition sequence search introduced by
Bergeron-Berstel-Brlek-Duboc in 1989 and later extended. This approach
utilizes a decomposition of an addition chain akin to continued fractions,
namely

```
(1,..., k,..., n) = (1,...,n mod k,..., k) {{ "\u2297" }} (1,..., n/k) {{ "\u2295" }} (n mod k).
```

for certain special operators {{ "\u2297" }} and {{ "\u2295" }}. This
decomposition lends itself to a recursive algorithm for efficient addition
sequence search, with results dependent on the _strategy_ for choosing the
auxillary integer _k_. The {{ pkg "alg/contfrac" }} package provides a
laundry list of strategies from the literature: binary, co-binary,
dichotomic, dyadic, fermat, square-root and total.

### Bos-Coster Heuristics

Bos and Coster described an iterative algorithm for efficient addition
sequence generation in which at each step a heuristic proposes new numbers
for the sequence in such a way that the _maximum_ number always decreases.
The [original Bos-Coster paper]({{ biburl "boscoster" }}) defined four
heuristics: Approximation, Divison, Halving and Lucas. Package
{{ pkg "alg/heuristic" }} implements a variation on these heuristics:

* **Approximation:** looks for two elements a, b in the current sequence with sum close to the largest element.
* **Halving:** applies when the target is at least twice as big as the next largest, and if so it will propose adding a sequence of doublings.
* **Delta Largest:** proposes adding the delta between the largest two entries in the current sequence.

Divison and Lucas are not implemented due to disparities in the literature
about their precise definition and poor results from early experiments.
Furthermore, this library does not apply weights to the heuristics as
suggested in the paper, rather it simply uses the first that applies. However
both of these remain [possible avenues for
improvement](https://github.com/mmcloughlin/addchain/issues/26).

### Dictionary

Dictionary methods decompose the binary representation of a target integer _n_ into a set of dictionary _terms_, such that _n_
may be written as a sum

```
n = {{ "\u2211" }} 2^{e_i} d_i
```

for exponents _e_ and elements _d_ from a dictionary _D_. Given such a decomposition we can construct an addition chain for _n_ by

1. Find a short addition _sequence_ containing every element of the dictionary _D_. Continued fractions and Bos-Coster heuristics can be used here.
2. Build _n_ from the dictionary terms according to the sum decomposition.

The efficiency of this approach boils down to the decomposition method. The {{ pkg "alg/dict" }} package provides:

* **Fixed Window:** binary representation of _n_ is broken into fixed _k_-bit windows
* **Sliding Window**: break _n_ into _k_-bit windows, skipping zeros where possible
* **Run Length**: decompose _n_ into runs of 1s up to a maximal length
* **Hybrid**: mix of sliding window and run length methods

### Runs

The runs algorithm is a custom variant of the dictionary approach that decomposes
a target into runs of ones. It leverages the observation that building a
dictionary consisting of runs of 1s of lengths `l_1, l_2, ..., l_k` can itself be
reduced to:

1. Find an addition sequence containing the run lengths `l_i`. As with
   dictionary approaches we can use Bos-Coster heuristics and continued
   fractions here. However here we have the advantage that the `l_i` are
   typically very _small_, meaning that a wider range of algorithms can
   be brought to bear.
2. Use the addition sequence for the run lengths `l_i` to build an addition
   sequence for the runs themselves `r(l_i)` where `r(e) = 2^e-1`. See
   {{ sym "alg/dict" "RunsChain" }}.

This approach has proved highly effective against cryptographic exponents
which frequently exhibit binary structure, such as those derived from
[Solinas primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solinas_prime).

> We have not yet found this method described in the literature, so it may be a new development.

### Optimization

Close inspection of addition chains produced by other algorithms revealed
cases of redundant computation. This motivated a final optimization pass over
addition chains to remove unecessary steps. The {{ pkg "alg/opt" }} package
implements the following optimization:

1. Determine _all possible_ ways each element can be computed from those prior.
2. Count how many times each element is used where it is the _only possible_ way of computing that entry.
3. Prune elements that are always used in computations that have an alternative.

These micro-optimizations were vital in closing the gap between `addchain`'s
automated approaches and hand-optimized chains. This technique is reminiscent
of basic passes in optimizing compilers, raising the question of whether
other [compiler optimizations could apply to addition
chains](https://github.com/mmcloughlin/addchain/issues/24)?
